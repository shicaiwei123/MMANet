# Official MMANet in PyTorch
Here is the official PyTorch implementation of MMANet proposed in ''*[MMANet: Margin-aware Distillation and Modality-aware Regularization for Incomplete Multimodal Learning](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wei_MMANet_Margin-Aware_Distillation_and_Modality-Aware_Regularization_for_Incomplete_Multimodal_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html)*''. 

It's a general framework to address the issue of multimodal learning with incomplete data. Details can be seen in our CVPR 2023 paper.


# Basic information of implementation

## Main Dependencies
- Ubuntu20.04
- CUDA 11.3
- Pytorch1.12.1
- Python 3.8

## Folder introduction
Our paper perform experiments on two classic multimodal tasks, e.g classification and segmentation.

The coressponding codes are deployed in *classification* and *segmentation* folders.
contains multimodal classification and segmentation tasks.

# Performance on multimodal classificaition task
Details can be seen in [Classification](https://github.com/shicaiwei123/MMANet/blob/main/classification/ReadMe.md)

# Performance on multimodal segmentation task
Details can be seen in [Segmentation](https://github.com/shicaiwei123/MMANet/blob/main/segmentation/ReadMe.md)
