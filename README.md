# Official MMANet in PyTorch
Here is the official PyTorch implementation of MMANet proposed in ''*MMANet: Margin-aware Distillation and Modality-aware Regularization for Incomplete Multimodal Learning*''. It's a general framework to address the issue of incomple multimodal inference. Details can be seen in our CVPR 2023 paper.

# Basic information of implementation

## Main Dependencies
- Ubuntu20.04
- CUDA 11.3
- Pytorch1.12.1
- Python 3.8

## Folder introduction
Our paper perform experiments on two classic multimodal tasks, e.g classification and segmentation.

The coressponding codes are deployed in *classification* and *segmentation* folders.
contains multimodal classification and segmentation tasks.

# Performance on multimodal classificaition task
Details can be seen in [Classification](https://github.com/shicaiwei123/MMANet/blob/main/classification/ReadMe.md)

# Performance on multimodal segmentation task
Details can be seen in [Segmentation](https://github.com/shicaiwei123/MMANet/blob/main/segmentation/ReadMe.md)
